Linear Regression with Boston Housing Dataset

<h2>Goal</h2>
> To predict the median value of houses in seveal Boston neighborhoods in the 1970s using the given features. 

Perhaps it is important to know what the columns in this dataset mean in full as they have benn shortened to make appear neat in a dataframe. 

- **CRIM** - per capita crime rate by town
- **ZN** - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- **INDUS** - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- **CHAS** - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- **NOX** - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- **RM** - average number of rooms per dwelling
- **AGE** - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- **DIS** - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
- **RAD** - index of accessibility to radial highways
- **TAX** - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- **PTRATIO** - pupil-teacher ratio by town
- **B** - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- **LSTAT** - % lower status of the population

What we are going to do is further look at the following Challenges:

- How to treat missing values
- How to treat outliers and 
- Understand which variables drive the price of homes in Boston
