# Linear Regression using Sklearn on Boston Housing Dataset
Linear Regression with Boston Housing Dataset

### Goal
> To predict housing costs/prices using the given features. 

Perhaps it is important to know what the columns in this dataset mean in full as they have benn shortened to make appear neat in a dataframe. 

- **CRIM** - per capita crime rate by town
- **ZN** - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- **INDUS** - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- **CHAS** - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
- **NOX** - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
- **RM** - average number of rooms per dwelling
- **AGE** - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
- **DIS** - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
- **RAD** - index of accessibility to radial highways
- **TAX** - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
- **PTRATIO** - pupil-teacher ratio by town
- **B** - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
- **LSTAT** - % lower status of the population
###- **MEDV** - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's####

What we are going to do is further look at the following Challenges:

- How to treat missing values
- How to treat outliers and 
- Understand which variables drive the price of homes in Boston
